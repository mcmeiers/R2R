R2R, short for RAG to Riches, provides the fastest and most efficient way to provide high quality RAG to end users. The framework is built around customizable pipelines and a feature-rich FastAPI implementation.

## Key Features

- **üöÄ Deploy**: Instantly launch production-ready RAG pipelines with streaming capabilities.
- **üß© Customize**: Tailor your pipeline with intuitive configuration files.
- **üîå Extend**: Enhance your pipeline with custom code integrations.
- **ü§ñ OSS**: Benefit from a framework developed by the open-source community, designed to simplify RAG deployment.
- **‚öñÔ∏è Autoscale**: Scale your pipeline effortlessly in the cloud using [SciPhi](https://app.sciphi.ai/).


## Why did we build this framework?

R2R was conceived to bridge the gap between local LLM experimentation and scalable production solutions. **R2R is to LangChain/LlamaIndex what NextJS is to React**.

## Demo(s)

Using the cloud application to deploy the pre-built basic pipeline:

Note - the example above uses [SciPhi Cloud](https://app.sciphi.ai) to pair with the R2R framework for deployment and observability. SciPhi is working to launch a self-hosted version of their cloud platform as R2R matures.
